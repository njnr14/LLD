design and implement a basic seat booking system for a single movie screen with the following functionalities:

View Available Seats → Users should be able to see available seats for a show.

Book a Seat → Users should be able to book a seat if available.

Cancel a Booking → Users should be able to cancel a previously booked seat.

Show Booked Seats → Users should be able to check which seats are booked.

Good things :- 

Functioning code.
Decent objects. 

Improvements  :-

Intro was not clear

Questions were vague. Shorten the user STORY

Function names = vacantSeats (//better would be displayVacantSeats, updateBooking?)

Error handling?

No understanding of concurrency.
