Design a polling system like whatsapp. 

The system should have the following functionality: -

Core Functionalities (MUST HAVE - MVP)

Create a Poll

- A user can create a poll inside a chat with a question, options, and created_by.

- Each option should have a unique option_id and text.

- Polls should have a poll_id and belong to a specific chat_id.

Vote on a Poll (Single Selection Only)

- A user can select one option from the poll.

- If they vote again, their previous vote should be replaced.

View Poll Results

- Show the number of votes per option.

- Display the percentage of total votes per option.

List All Polls in a Chat

- Fetch all polls for a specific chat, showing status (active or closed).

Prevent Duplicate Voting

- Ensure a user can’t vote twice unless they change their vote.

Phase 2: Enhancements (NICE TO HAVE)

Poll Closing Time

- Allow the creator to set a closing time after which voting is disabled.

Anonymous Polls

- Allow the creator to hide who voted for what.

Multiple Selection Polls

- Allow the poll creator to enable multiple-choice voting.
