carpooling: Ride creation and bookingDescriptionDescriptionThis problem focuses on building the foundation of the carpooling application, enabling users to register rides and book them based on proximity. Features- A user can register a ride with start and end locations.- A user can search for available rides within 5km of their provided start and end location.- A user can book a ride if available.- Once a vehicle is fully booked, it is no longer available. Distance Calculation Formula: Simple Euclidean Distance Formula (approximate for small distances): distance = sqrt((lat2-lat1)%C2%B2 + (long2-long1)%C2%B2) * 111 Where 111 is approximate km per degree at equator Note: This is a simplified version for coding purposes. For real-world applications, Haversine formula would be more accurate.
