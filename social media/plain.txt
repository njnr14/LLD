Design a simplified version of a social media feed system (like Instagram or Facebook), where users can post content, follow other users, and view a personalized feed.

Your task is to implement the core functionality of such a system that includes users, posts, and a feed sorted by recency (latest posts first).

1. User Management
Create users with a name and unique ID.

Users can follow or unfollow other users.

Each user should maintain a list of who they follow.


2. Post Management
Users can create posts (just a string message or caption).

Each post has a unique post ID, timestamp, and creator.



3. Feed Generation
A user can view their feed which contains:

Posts created by the users they follow.

Posts sorted in reverse chronological order (newest first).

Limit the number of posts in the feed to the most recent k (say 10) posts.

Nice-to-Have Functionalities (for discussion or time permitting)
1. Like Feature
Users can like a post.

Track number of likes per post.

Prevent the same user from liking a post multiple times.

2. Comment Feature
Users can comment on posts.

Store a list of comments per post.

3. Hashtag Search
Allow tagging posts with hashtags (e.g., #vacation, #food).

Users can search posts using hashtags.

4. Post Deletion
A user can delete their own posts.

Deleted posts should disappear from the feed.
